# Kubernetes YAML Manifests

### 1. Docker image:
To build the Docker image, a **Dockerfile** is created, and then the command `docker build -t "image_name" .` is run in the Docker CLI. Here, I have created a Docker image "**task_2**" for the Dockerfile, which was created for Kaiburr assessment **task_1**.
